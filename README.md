# AudioPlugin
Simple little Audio Equalizer


This Plugin is made with the Juce Library. 

In Order to open it you need to download the Latest version of the Juce Library and build the Projucer Application (found in JUCE\extras\Projucer\Builds).
At this point you need to select your IDE and give it a quick build.

After that you can download my repository and open it up with the Projucer Explorer. You can set it up and give it a build. Works as a Standalone and as VST3 

Preferably open it in Abletion live 10 since this is the Version i tested it in and there are no Errors as if right now. 


I will update the Repository quite frequently in the Future so be sure to check out the changes every now and then. 

I will try to implement a Response Curve that gives feedback on how the sound is beeing manipulated. On top of that i will try to visualize 
the actual sound that is coming into the VST Plugin.
