Simple little Audio Equalizer


This little Plugin is made with the Juce Library. 

In Order to open it you need to download the Latest version of the Juce Library and build the Projucer Application (found in JUCE\extras\Projucer\Builds).
At this point you need to select your IDE and give it a quick build.

After that you can download my repository and open it up with the Projucer Explorer. You can set it up and give it a build. Works as a Standalone and as VST3 

Preferably open it in Abletion live 10 since this is the Version i tested it in and there are no Errors as if right now.
